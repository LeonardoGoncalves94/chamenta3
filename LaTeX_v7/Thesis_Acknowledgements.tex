I would like to my thank supervisors, professor Nuno Santos and Carlos Cardoso and other Multicert staff who guided and supported me through this thesis. Orientation was a key point in this work as it allowed me to keep focused and on the right path. 

I would like to thank my family, who throughout my academic journey encouraged me to never stop and reach for the end. For all the patience, financial and emotional support I am grateful.

I would like to thank my closest friends, who accompany me in this project from the beginning, for standing at my side in the moments of pressure. For your help and caring I thank you all.

I would also like to acknowledge Multicert and my university for making this project possible, for the opportunity of working in a real development team and providing me with excellent means to learn and grow as a professional and person.
